Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Timothy, and I'm an MD/PhD student studying cancer biology and biomedical informatics at the Stanford University School of Medicine. This website serves as a brief introduction to me and the work I do scientifically and professionally. (Also, if you're here because you're thinking about hiring me, free to check out my cv [here](https://github.com/keyes-timothy/misc/blob/master/tkeyes_cv.pdf).)

Currently, I'm in the middle of the PhD years of my MD/PhD program as a joint member of [Kara Davis's laboratory](https://med.stanford.edu/kldavislab/people.html) in the Department of Pediatrics and [Garry Nolan's Laboratory](http://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) in the Department of Pathology here at Stanford. 

Specifically, my research focuses on the application of machine learning to single-cell data analysis in the context of pediatric leukemia. Through the use of emerging, high-throughout single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry and sequence-based cytometry, I try to build predictive models of patient outcomes that operate at the time of diagnosis. To do so, I use a variety of computational tools including generalized linear models, various forms of clustering, and deep learning. In general, I'm also **really** invested in building easy-to-use, highly-reproducible data analysis pipelines that can be shared as open-source tools for the scientific community (check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/keyes-timothy) to see some of my work).

Outside of science, I also have a longstanding interest in human rights and social justice work within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community. I currently serve as the resident data scientist for the [Medical Student Pride Alliance (MSPA)](https://www.medpride.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that advocates for diversity, equity, and inclusion for LGBTQ+ medical students in medical schools across the United States. In my role at MSPA, I analyze and visualize data that guide MSPA's strategic decision-making (as well as for academic publication). I also mentor other student members of MSPA performing data analysis in Python and R.

If you want to learn more about me or get in contact for any reason, feel free to email me at tkeyes@stanford.edu or at timothy.keyes@medpride.org. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
